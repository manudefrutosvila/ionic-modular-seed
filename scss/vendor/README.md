The `app/scss/vendor/` directory
==========================================

The third party libraries are imported here.
It is the place to customize them by overriding its variables.

There are two ways to do it:

- If we use bower to import the library, we can import directly from the folder bower_components. This should be the right choice if possible.
- It can be also copied here the sass files of the library and then imported.
